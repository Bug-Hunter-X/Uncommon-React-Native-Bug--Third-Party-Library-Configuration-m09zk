To solve this, ensure that you have followed all of the instructions for the specific library that you are using. This may include installing the library, linking it to your project, and making any necessary changes to your code.  Here is an example of how to correctly install and link the react-native-vector-icons library:

1. Install the library using npm or yarn:
```bash
npm install react-native-vector-icons
```

2. Link the library to your project (may vary based on library and RN version):
```bash
react-native link react-native-vector-icons
```

3. If automatic linking fails, follow the manual linking instructions in the library's documentation. 

4. Import the icons and use them in your code.

```javascript
import Icon from 'react-native-vector-icons/Ionicons';

<Icon name="ios-home" size={30} color="black" />
```
Always refer to the library's specific documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date installation and usage instructions.
